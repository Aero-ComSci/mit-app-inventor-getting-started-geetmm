My experience consisted of a couple ups and downs. At first, I deemed this to be quite difficult as MIT app inventor and GIThub were all new platoforms for me. As we moved on, I had a few doubts which were quickly resolved. I'm sure as the year goes on, I will become more familiarized with both platforms, making assignments easier for me.
